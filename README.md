#  Tech Challenge
This challenge is part of the hiring process  for frontend developer roles. The objective is to produce this without investing any more time than necessary. As such, we'd like to see your regular conventions when writing an application.

Some of these are
- Good commit & branching conventions
- Handling of network requests
- Typescript
- Routing
- State management
- Framework (React) conventions
- Semantic HTML
- CSS and general ability to produce a polished end result  - responsiveness is low priority, but appreciated

## What do you need to produce?
We're asking you to build a basic storefront using [https://fakestoreapi](Fake Store API)

We would like for you to get all products and display them as cards on a page, with the ability to add items to a cart.

There is a _lot_ of room to go above the expected outcome, and please feel free to tackle something that is relevant to your current level (this would be optional)

_Some_ examples of this would be 
- Using a global state manager in an efficient way
- Multiple routes
- Great visuals
